## Decision Trees (Regression)

### Task 1: Implement Impurity Calculation
- **Objective:** Implement a function to calculate impurity using the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
- **Output:**
  - Function was verified using test cases.
  - Results matched expectations, with correct impurity values.

### Task 2: Define a Cost Function
- **Objective:** Implement a cost function to evaluate splits based on impurity.
- **Output:**
  - Cost function was validated on sample datasets.
  - Correct values were computed for split evaluations.

### Task 3: Build and Train a Custom Decision Tree Regressor
- **Objective:** Implement a decision tree regressor from scratch with split selection, tree growth, and prediction logic.
- **Output:**
  - The custom tree predictions aligned closely with scikit-learn's implementation.

### Task 4: Train Regression Trees on the Boston Dataset
- **Objective:** Train decision trees with depths of 1 and 2 and compare their performance.
- **Key Insights:**
  - **Train MAE (depth 1):** 5.09 | **Test MAE:** 4.87
  - **Train MAE (depth 2):** 3.54 | **Test MAE:** 3.66
  - **Overfitting:** Trees with depth 2 did not show significant overfitting.

### Task 5: Optimize Hyperparameters Using GridSearchCV
- **Objective:** Use GridSearchCV to optimize `max_depth` and `min_samples_leaf`.
- **Output:**
  - **Best Parameters:** `{'max_depth': 6, 'min_samples_leaf': 2}`
  - **Test MAE:** 2.46
  - GridSearchCV effectively improved performance by identifying optimal hyperparameters.

### Task 6: Calculate Bias and Variance
- **Objective:** Implement an algorithm to estimate bias and variance using bootstrap sampling.
- **Results:**
  - **Bias²:** 20.21 | **Variance:** 140.41
  - The model exhibited low bias and relatively high variance, characteristic of decision trees.

### Task 7: Analyze Effect of `min_samples_split`
- **Objective:** Plot bias and variance for different `min_samples_split` values.
- **Results:**
  - Increasing `min_samples_split` reduced variance slightly but increased bias.
  - **Key Observation:** A trade-off exists between bias and variance, aligning with theoretical expectations.

### Task 8: Reduce Variance with Bagging
- **Objective:** Use bagging to reduce the variance of the decision tree.
- **Results:**
  - **Bias² (Bagging):** 14.31 | **Variance (Bagging):** 139.28
  - Bagging effectively reduced variance compared to a single tree, validating its theoretical advantage.
